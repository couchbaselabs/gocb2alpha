# Couchbase Go Alpha v2 Client

This is the v2 alpha version of official Couchbase Go SDK. If you are 
looking for the official stable package then go to [gocb](http://github.com/couchbase/gocb).

The Go SDK library allows you to connect to a Couchbase cluster from
Go. It is written in pure Go, and uses the included gocbcore library to
handle communicating to the cluster over the Couchbase binary
protocol.
